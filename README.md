# Streaming with LLM

!LLM Streaming

This repository contains an application (`app.py`) that demonstrates streaming data using LLM (Language Model). LLMs are powerful tools for natural language processing, and this project showcases how to integrate them into a streaming application.

## Features

- **Real-time Streaming**: The app processes incoming data streams and generates LLM-based responses.
- **Customizable LLM Models**: You can choose different pre-trained LLMs (such as GPT-3, BERT, or RoBERTa) based on your use case.
- **Scalability**: The architecture is designed to handle large-scale data streams efficiently.

## Installation

- Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imanoop7/streaming_with_llm.git


## Configuration
Customize the LLM model by adjusting parameters in app.py.
Implement additional features, such as sentiment analysis or named entity recognition, using LLM outputs.
